# Testing-Code – My First Steps in C++ Programming

This project contains some of my very first experiments with coding — created right after writing my initial "Hello World" program. These small wins may seem basic now, but they were a huge step at the time and mark the real start of my journey into software and game development.

## 🧠 What This Project Represents

- My first self-written lines of C++ after learning the syntax
- Early experimentation with `std::cout`, variables, and control flow
- Built using Visual Studio as part of learning the IDE and build process

## 💭 Reflection

Everyone starts somewhere — and this is where I started.

From here I went on to build:
- A modular game engine in C++
- Tools using ImGui and SDL
- Full Unity games with complete gameplay systems
- Real-time graphics and shader projects

This repo stays public as a reminder that growth happens through consistency, practice, and a bit of trial and error.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

It's rough, it's raw — but it's real.  
And it's the foundation of everything I’ve built since.
