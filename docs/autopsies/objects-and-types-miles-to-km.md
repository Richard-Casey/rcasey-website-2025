# Miles to Kilometers – C++ Object and Types Practice

This is a beginner-level C++ project built during my early university studies. It was created to practice using objects, primitive types, and basic user input/output in C++. The project implements a simple miles-to-kilometers converter, using clean code and structured output.

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Working with basic types (`float`, `double`)
- Understanding how to structure a simple C++ console program
- Performing real-world unit conversion with user input
- Formatting output for clarity and precision

---

## 💡 Features

- Asks the user for a distance in miles
- Converts the value into kilometers using a static formula
- Displays the result with simple formatting

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Format:** `.sln` and `.vcxproj` build setup

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This was one of my first meaningful attempts at writing a complete, functional program. While simple, it shows my early focus on clarity, correct syntax, and user interaction. It’s a small but important step in my growth as a developer.
