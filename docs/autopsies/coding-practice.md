# Coding Practice â€“ Early University C++ Exercises

This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs written during the **first few weeks** of my BSc Games Development degree at the University of Suffolk. The goal was to reinforce lecture content by rewriting and testing concepts like control flow, loops, pointers, and simple I/O.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

Each folder contains a Visual Studio project focused on a particular concept:

- `LoopsPractice` â€“ Standard for/while loop structure
- `Pointers` â€“ Intro to pointer syntax and usage
- `IfStatements` â€“ Conditional branching logic
- `WhileLoopsPractice` â€“ Flow repetition and checks

These were hands-on exercises built alongside lectures to make sure I understood the logic and structure of early C++ programming.

## ðŸ›  Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Style:** Procedural-focused intro logic

## ðŸ§¹ Notes

There was an older/early duplicate of a game engine project also included in this repo (`GameEngineDevelopment/`). That folder has since been removed as it is now properly represented and documented in my [University-Year-2 repository](https://github.com/Richard-Casey/University-Year-2).

## ðŸ’­ Reflection

This was the stage where I was first getting comfortable with:
- Compiling my own code
- Understanding `main()`, variables, and memory
- Seeing cause-and-effect through code changes

It's basic â€” but it's real. These are the bricks I laid before jumping into engines, tools, and full games.

## ðŸ™Œ Final Thoughts

Keeping this repo public is important to me. It shows where I started and reminds me that everyone builds up from somewhere. The effort here led to game engines, AI systems, and dissertation-level work just a year later.
