# University Year 1 – BSc (Hons) Games Development (Programming)

This repository contains the full collection of coursework I completed during my **first year (2021–2022)** at the University of Suffolk. While Year 1 modules do not contribute directly toward my final degree classification, they laid the essential foundation for my future studies in systems programming, game development, and technical design.

Each folder represents a core module undertaken throughout the academic year — covering everything from academic writing and C# fundamentals to Unity projects, algorithms, and applied mathematics for games.
