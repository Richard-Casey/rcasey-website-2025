# Wrestling Ring Prototype â€“ Rope Physics & Procedural Construction (Unity)

This is a **personal prototype project** exploring the idea of a wrestling-themed game, with an initial focus on simulating the physical structure of a wrestling ring using Unity.

While the gameplay is not developed and the simulation is currently non-functional, this project served as a sandbox to experiment with:

- ðŸª¢ **Rope physics and procedural rope generation**
- ðŸ§± **Prefabricated components** for a full wrestling ring
- ðŸŽ® **Scene construction** for testing game-ready arenas
- ðŸŽ¨ **Material and texture setup**, including WCW branding for fun and realism

---

## ðŸ”§ What's Included

- `WrestlingRing.unity` â€“ Primary scene for layout testing
- `RopeCreator.cs` â€“ Custom script for generating ring ropes procedurally
- Prefabs:
  - `RingPost`, `TurnbucklePad`, `Clasp`, `Rope`, `WrestlingMat`
- Materials:
  - `RopeMaterial`, `CanvasMaterial`, `TurnbuckleMaterial`, `WCW Texture`
- Unity project files and configuration

---

## ðŸš§ Status

**Work-in-progress / shelved prototype.**  
The rope logic and prefab placement system need further work before a playable or visual prototype is complete. That said, the setup demonstrates direction and a unique use case that could be expanded on in future projects.

## ðŸ§  Reflection

I began this as part of a larger idea for a wrestling-themed game, but pivoted to focus solely on the technical challenge of **rope simulation and arena layout**. Even though it's incomplete, it's part of the process of iterating on ideas and learning Unityâ€™s physics and prefab systems in a practical way.

I'll likely return to this project once I've had more time to explore advanced joint-based physics and scene control systems.
