# University Year 2 – BSc (Hons) Games Development (Programming)

This repository contains all major coursework completed during my second year at the University of Suffolk (2022–2023). Each module in this collection demonstrates different aspects of my technical, academic, and professional growth as a game developer — ranging from engine programming and AI to academic research and full solo game development.

## 📚 Modules & Highlights

### 1. 🎮 Game Engine Development
Developed a modular game engine in C++ using SDL. Built core systems including a scene manager, resource manager, profiler, and implemented a playable demo game to validate the engine.

**Grade:** 71% – First Class

---

### 2. 🧱 Programming for Graphics
Used modern OpenGL and GLSL shaders to implement a 3D graphics pipeline. Demonstrated lighting models, textured meshes, and real-time camera and shader logic.

**Grade:** 64% – Upper Second

---

### 3. 📖 Games Research Methods
Submitted a research proposal and academic presentation in preparation for the final-year dissertation. Focused on developing research questions, ethical methodologies, and literature reviews.

**Grade:** 62% – Upper Second

---

### 4. 🛠 Tools Programming
Extended my custom game engine with GUI tools using ImGui. Implemented hierarchy management, asset dragging, object parenting, and in-editor profiling.

**Grade:** 65% – Upper Second

---

### 5. 🤖 Artificial Intelligence for Games
Built a predator/prey simulation in C++ using SFML. Applied AI techniques including Finite State Machines, Steering Behaviours, A* Pathfinding, and Behaviour Trees.

**Grade:** 54% – Lower Second

---

### 6. 🃏 Group Project – Top-Bird
Originally a failed group effort that I later rebuilt solo in 10 days after appealing to the university board. Developed the *entire game* independently in Unity — design, UI, logic, AI, unlockables, menus, and more.

**Final Module Grade:** 72% – First Class (100% Solo Resubmission)

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

Second year challenged me to grow rapidly as both a programmer and a professional. I tackled custom engines, OpenGL rendering, real-time AI, solo production deadlines, and academic theory — all while balancing full-time parenting and charity work.

This year was a turning point in both my confidence and capability as a game developer.
