# Beginning C++ Through Game Programming – Book Practice Projects (SFML)

This repository contains the projects I developed while working through the book *"Beginning C++ Through Game Programming"* by **Michael Dawson**. I tackled this book at the end of my first year at university as part of my effort to expand my knowledge of C++ outside of formal coursework.

It focuses on **hands-on game development using C++ and SFML**, with two complete projects and supporting experiments.

## 📚 Projects Included

### 🪓 Timber (SFML)
An arcade-style reflex game where the player chops down a tree while avoiding falling branches.

**Features:**
- Sprite animation using SFML
- Time-based score system
- Sound effects for chopping, timeouts, and death
- Keyboard input and basic state management
- Object movement and dynamic UI

### 🧟 Zombie Arena (SFML)
A top-down survival shooter where the player fends off waves of zombies while collecting health and ammo pickups.

**Features:**
- Player and zombie classes with full OOP structure
- Enemy AI movement and collision logic
- Shooting, reloading, and pickup mechanics
- Dynamic background tile generation
- Particle blood effects and sound design

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Reinforce C++ fundamentals (classes, inheritance, pointers, references)
- Gain experience building full gameplay systems from scratch
- Get comfortable with SFML for rendering, audio, and input
- Understand the game loop, state management, and asset handling

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Library:** SFML 2.5.1 (bundled)
- **Editor:** Visual Studio
- **Format:** `.sln` and `.vcxproj` based builds

## 💭 Reflection

This repo represents the first time I fully implemented gameplay systems in C++ on my own. It pushed me beyond lecture content and gave me confidence in:
- Working with libraries
- Structuring game objects
- Troubleshooting logic across real-time systems

I still use many of the principles I learned here in my Unity and C++ projects today.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This is a public record of my self-driven learning journey in C++. These projects laid the groundwork for future engine work, tools, and gameplay systems in my university degree and personal prototypes.
