Pet System in C#  
A simple demo of Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism using pets.  

## 🧪 Concepts Demonstrated  
- Interface: IFeedable  
- Abstract Class: Pet  
- Concrete Classes: Dog, Cat  
- Polymorphism via List<Pet>  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

## 🐾 How It Works  
Each pet has a name, can speak in its own way, and be fed.  
We create a list of pets and treat them polymorphically as the base Pet type.  
This demo is a clean example of real-world OOP in action.
