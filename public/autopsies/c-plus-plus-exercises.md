# C++ Exercises – Book-Based & Independent Practice Projects

This repository contains a variety of small C++ projects and programming exercises I completed outside of formal coursework. Many of these were inspired by coding books, self-imposed challenges, or online programming tasks I encountered during my first and second year of university.

---

## 🧠 What This Repo Is

- A sandbox of **independent practice**
- A way for me to apply knowledge from textbooks and tutorials
- A collection of **focused mini-projects**, each exploring a single programming concept

---

## 📁 Folder Breakdown

- `11-1`, `11-4` – Numbered book-based exercises (chapter/task format)
- `Roman-Int` – Roman numeral to integer conversion
- `CalculatorDraft` – Early attempt at a C++ calculator app
- `book-class` – Object-oriented experiment involving classes and methods
- `WritingaProgramTask2Draft` – General logic and syntax experimentation
- `functionetcAssess2` – Function pointers, references, or similar concepts
- `new-file-task` – Likely another small challenge or draft

Each folder is its own self-contained Visual Studio C++ project and was developed during spare time to reinforce concepts like:

- Functions and control flow
- Input/output
- Object-oriented design
- Loops and logic structures

---

## 🛠 Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Community
- **Style:** Primarily procedural, with early OOP attempts

## 💭 Reflection

This repo represents my **self-led learning** — driven by curiosity and the desire to improve outside the classroom. It’s not about completeness or perfection, but about showing the reps I put in to understand C++ deeper at my own pace.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

I’ve kept this repo public because I think it's important to show:
- Where the passion kicks in outside of assignments
- The value of just *doing the work*, no matter how small
- My willingness to keep learning even when no one’s watching
