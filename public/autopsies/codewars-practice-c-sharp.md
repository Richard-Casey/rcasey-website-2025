# Codewars Practice â€“ C#

This repository contains a small collection of my early attempts at solving Codewars challenges using **C#**. While short-lived, this repo represents my early interest in sharpening core algorithm and syntax skills outside of my usual game dev work.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Attempted

- **Convert Number to Reversed Array of Digits**  
- **Returning Strings**  
- **Sum Arrays**

These problems focus on basic data manipulation, string formatting, and numerical logic â€” foundational concepts that reinforce core C# skills.

## ðŸ’­ Reflection

Though this practice streak was brief, it sparked a greater interest in clean function writing and solving small problems efficiently. I plan to revisit and expand this repo as time allows.

Even a few well-structured solutions can show:
- Solid naming conventions
- Clean syntax
- An understanding of basic algorithmic problem-solving

---

## ðŸ”§ Language & Tools

- **Language:** C#
- **Platform:** [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- **Editor:** Visual Studio / JetBrains Rider (depending on setup)

## ðŸ™Œ Final Thoughts

This repo is a snapshot of the start of my algorithm journey â€” and Iâ€™ve learned a lot since. It stays public as a reminder of that, and a place to continue adding bite-sized C# logic over time.
